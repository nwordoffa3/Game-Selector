# Game Collection
This is a small collection of 8-bit games built using Python. It includes four classic games: Snake, Pong, Hangman and Tic Tac Toe. All games are placed in one executable, making it easy to play and switch between them.

I built this game collection as a small hackathon project during my spring semester because I had some free time. I hope you enjoy playing these games as much as I enjoyed building them!

## Game Instructions
Snake
Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake. The goal is to eat the food that appears on the screen, grow your snake, and avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.

### Pong
Use the up and down arrow keys to move the paddle and hit the ball. The goal is to score points by making the ball go past your opponent's paddle.

### Hangman
Guess the word by selecting letters on the screen. If you choose a wrong letter, part of the hangman will appear. The goal is to guess the word before the hangman is complete.

### Tic Tac Toe
Two players take turns placing their X or O in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three in a row before your opponent does.
